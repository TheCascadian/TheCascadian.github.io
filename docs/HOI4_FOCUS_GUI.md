## LINUX SUPPORT STATUS

- Linux packaging support is now included in this repository.
- GitHub release builds are configured to generate:
- Windows build artifact (`.zip` bundle containing `.exe`).
- Linux `.AppImage`.
- Linux `.deb`.
- Linux startup diagnostics now write to `Logs/log.txt` so launch problems are easier to troubleshoot.

### AppImage Runtime Requirement

- Direct AppImage launch requires FUSE2 compatibility (`libfuse.so.2`; on newer Debian-based systems this is typically `libfuse2t64`).
- If FUSE2 is missing, AppImage launch can fail before the app UI appears.
- A fallback launcher script may be generated with local builds for no-FUSE testing (`APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` mode).

### Release Flow

- Push to `main` for regular code updates.
- Push a tag that starts with `v` (example: `v1.0.10`) to trigger full release artifact generation.
- Manual workflow dispatch is also supported when providing a release tag input.

## ⚠️ USER WARNING (Norton AV & Windows Defender)

- This will likely be flagged as a virus -- mainly because it is an .exe file made with the use of PyInstaller via AutoPyToExe. Also, I cannot afford to certify this app. 
- If you still want to use it: on the right side of the options for it, there's "Restore", and "Add Exclusion and Restore", click the second option. This should allow you to use the app.

## ⚠️ **PLEASE READ!**

1. **Save frequently.** There *IS* now an auto-save feature. Backup your files in another folder when exporting to HOI4 code. Auto-save is NOT a replacement for backups and manual saving.
2. **Toolkit is still in very early development.** Paradox are prone to breaking changes in modding, so, if you notice something out of the ordinary, feel free to stop in to my discord and let me know what's going on!

## Peace of Mind

- **All data is stored locally, on YOUR PC, forever** (until deleted/removed/transferred).
- **No server setup, no installer** (also means no uninstaller, everything is held here: `AppData\Local\FocusTool` -- EXCEPT the .exe itself).
